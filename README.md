# Smartwatch-based ecological momentary assessmentsfor occupant wellness and privacy in buildings

This repository contains the data and example code of the Cozie deployment for a Indoor Air 2022 Paper on Occupant Wellness and Privacy

Abstract: This  paper  describes  the  adaptation  of  an  open-source  ecological  momentaryassessment platform (Cozie â€“https://github.com/cozie-app) with three sets of micro-surveywellness-related  questions  focused  on  i)  infectious  disease  (COVID-19)  risk  perception;  ii)triggers  of  various  movement-related  behaviors  in  buildings;  and,  iii)  privacy  and  distractionin an office context.  This platform was previously used to collect data in a longitudinal thermalcomfort experiment, and this work extends its use to other domains.  Seven research participantstook part in an experiment by wearing a Fitbit Versa smartwatch to collect their micro-surveyquestion preferences and perception responses.  Participants were also asked to install an indoorlocalization app on their phone to detect where precisely in the building they completed thesurvey.    The  experiment  identified  occupant  information  such  as  the  motivations  for  mostresearch participants to take the stairs instead of a lift and the difference between infectiousdisease risk perception in naturally versus mechanically ventilated spaces.
